This repository contains the code for the paper [**NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) by Matthew Tancik, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Ren Ng, Justin Johnson, and Bryan Catanzaro. The attempt is to learn a continuous volumetric representation of a scene from a set of images and use it to render novel views. The model is trained end-to-end to minimize a reconstruction loss and a smoothness loss. The model is trained on the pytorch lightning framework.
